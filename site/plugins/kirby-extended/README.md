# Kirby Extended

This package extends Kirby's base capabilities. It is built mostly upon existing packages, but unifies them under one namespace and further updates their original functionalities which includes fixing open issues.

## Included Adapters

## Env

> Forked from [kirby-env](https://github.com/beebmx/kirby-env) by Fernando GutiÃ©rrez

Loads environment variables from `.env` automatically. This helps to store project credentials or variables outside of your code or if you want to have development and production access in different locations.

The `.env` file is generally kept out of version control since it can contain sensitive information. A separate `.env.example` file is created with all the required environment variables defined except for the sensitive ones, which are either user-supplied for their own development environments or are communicated elsewhere to project collaborators.

The `EnvAdapter` class uses the `vlucas/phpdotenv` package and enables its features for Kirby.
